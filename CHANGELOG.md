* New feature: nzb files can now be checked for completeness. The feature is activated by default but can be deactivated in the general settings. Also the threshold value for missing files and segments can be changed.
  
  **NOTE:** the check for completeness is very basic and limited because it depends mostly on the information provided in the file's subject set by the program used to upload the files to the usenet. Unfortunately there is no official standard for the file's subject for multiple file uploads.
* New feature: a desktop notification will now show up if the script has started to search for the nzb file. Informative notifications (e.g. upon start of the script) will have the standard blue icon. Success notification will have green icon and error notification a red icon for better differentiation.

  * Now all nzb files found will be downloaded and the first valid nzb file will be saved or pushed to the download program.
